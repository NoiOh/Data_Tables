# Data_Tables
I created a web application that will help display outgoing shipment in real time.

Language used to create this data table.
phpMyAdmin to create the database
PHP to pull from the database
Javascript using Bootstrap and Datatables

Admin_interface file makes it easier to search through the database. You'll be able to create, edit, or delete work orders.
Display_inteface file displays shipments in real time.
